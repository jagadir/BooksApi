# BooksApi
BooksApi Built on .net 6.0 framework

BookApi project contains CRUD API operations with .Net core inMemory as data store. 

BooksApiTests has tests for all the CRUD operations. xUnit framework is used for writing the unit tests. 

Note: This project is built with the help of AI pair programmer (Git Copilot). It's awesome, it really save good amount of time. 

I have used an evaluation version of the Git Copilot for 30 days.
